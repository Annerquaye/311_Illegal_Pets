# Illegal animals kept as pets in NYC

This analysis focus on 311 complaints filed by residents from 2010 to February 2022.

Generally, I found downloading 311 data as a monstrous exercise so for the first part of this work, I used a slice (dummy) of the full 311 data
to provide a walkthrough of my processs. This shows how to get around the 311 data.

After locating the subset of the data I need to work with, I went to the data.nyc and downloaded the subset using the complaint type and descriptor to locate 'Illegal animal kept as pet'.

The analysis was first to find out how many complaints have been filed against illegal animals being kept as pets; the type of these animals and also
where the complaints are coming from.
